# CountryWealthandtheEnvironment
Today, one of the biggest problems the world is facing is the state of the environment.Climate Change and the warming of the earth will impact everyone and many scientists believe that countries need to act immediately. Yet, when discussing this issue many wonder who is causing the most impact. Is it the rich, developed countries or poorer, undeveloped countries?
Therefore, the purpose of this Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree project is to use data analytics to help understand the relatioship between wealth and environental impact. Simultaneously,we will also analyze wealth trends and learn how wealth is dispersered throughought the world. To perform this study, we will be using the following indicators obtained from Gapminder database: CO2 emmisions per person(tonnes/person), GNI per captia (Atlas method), Energy production per person ( tonnes of oil equivalent/person), and Percent Agricultural Land. Gapminder provides data over many years for each country.
